    <IntroFeature iconName="AimOutlined">
        Use language models as focused processing components rather than
        overburdened pseudo-humans.
    </IntroFeature>
    <IntroFeature iconName="PartitionOutlined">
        Guide language models along predefined logic of your own design,
        drastically improving performance and cost-efficiency.
    </IntroFeature>
    <IntroFeature iconName="ApiOutlined">
        Use other software and frameworks from OmniChain via HTTP requests and
        system commands. Use OmniChain from other software via its own HTTP API.
    </IntroFeature>
    <IntroFeature iconName="GlobalOutlined">
        Access the underlying operating system to read/write files and run
        commands, or access external services via HTTP requests, turning your
        workflows into powerful integrations.
    </IntroFeature>
    <IntroFeature iconName="SyncOutlined">
        Build workflows that can loop and run 24/7, with the ability to pause
        for user input, and resume when ready.
    </IntroFeature>
    <IntroFeature iconName="CodeOutlined">
        Easily make custom nodes, use JS eval nodes to run custom code, and
        optionally have the AI generate the code for you.
    </IntroFeature>
    <IntroFeature iconName="SaveOutlined">
        Use the chain's self-modification capabilities to store and reuse data
        at any point in the chain, and export the chain with the data included.
    </IntroFeature>
    <IntroFeature iconName="SafetyOutlined">
        Private, self-hosted, fully open-source, and available for commercial
        use via the non-restrictive MIT license.
