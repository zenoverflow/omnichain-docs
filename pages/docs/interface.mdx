## UI Basics

The UI is divided into three main sections:

-   The top bar, which contains the Nodes Index, API Keys, and Avatars menus. It will also contain a button to open the chat view if you are currently inside the editor.

-   The sidebar, which lets you import and create chains, and lists all the chains in your workspace.

-   The main view, which is either the Editor or the Chat.

## Editor

The Editor is where you build your chains. As you saw from the previous screenshot, it has two main areas:

-   The canvas, where you place your nodes and connect them to create your logic.

-   The top bar, where you have a button to start and stop the chain, as well as a button to open the properties menu, which contains some basic options for the chain, including the abilities to rename, export, and delete it.

Learn how to use Chains in the Editor in the [Chains](/chains) section.

## Chat

The Chat allows you to interact with your chains. It supports sending images and regular files inside each message. What happens with your messages depends on the chain you are currently running.

## Nodes Index

The Nodes Index (open via the book icon in the top bar) shows a list of all nodes available in your workspace, including custom nodes you have created or imported from third parties. The nodes in OmniChain are built to have embedded documentation, which you can view by expanding the node's list entry. Note that the documentation in custom and third-party nodes depends on their developers.

## API Keys

The API Keys menu allows you to store API keys that can be used by chains at runtime. It is recommended to use this feature instead of hardcoding your API keys inside your chains, so that you can safely export your chains without worrying about exposing your keys.

## Avatars

The Avatars menu allows you to manage your avatars - these are purely cosmetic, and define the profile images and names that show up along with messages in the chat. Chains can be configured to send responses with specific avatars, and you can also set an avatar for yourself.
