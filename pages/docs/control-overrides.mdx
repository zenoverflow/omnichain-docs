Some nodes in OmniChain support overriding control values externally. You can tell by the `override` string input present on these nodes.

This input expects a JSON object (as a string). You can see the properties to use in the object by looking at the node's documentation, either in the node index or in the node's help popup.

Overrides are meant to allow customization of controls via an external source like output from an LLM. For example, if you were making a chain with some sort of self-correction behavior, you could have a LLM (or your own logic) automatically alter settings like `temperature` or `top_k` for an LLM node.

Example screenshot:

<a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    href="/images/s_overrides_example.png"
>

</a>

In the screenshot above, the `temperature` and `top_k` values in the node's controls are being ignored in favor of those passed in via the `override` input. A TemplateBuilder node is used to insert the values into a JSON object to use as the override input.
