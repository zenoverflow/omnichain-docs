## Use OmniChain via Open WebUI

Open WebUI is a powerful frontend with a broad scope of functionality and a clean professional interface.

As of version 0.3.4, OmniChain's API is compatible with Open WebUI. To see your chains in Open WebUI, open the admin panel and go to Settings > Connections. There, in the OpenAI API section, you can add OmniChain's OpenAI endpoint like this:

Note that you need to enter some random string as an API key. Leaving the field blank causes Open WebUI to ignore the connection. OmniChain itself doesn't come with an auth mechanism, so it will accept any API key.
